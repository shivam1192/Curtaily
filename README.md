# Curtaily

Google had shut downed its URL shortener service, goo.gl on 30 March 2019, and According to their announcement any URLs you made previously will keep working. 
~This is old news, But we have to find alternatives to that.


Curtaily is a URL Shortner on Ethereum Blockchain that stores the curtailed link forever. You have to pay a minimal gas fee for every curtailed link. Being a Decentralized application means that this web app does not require any centralized database to function. It only interacts with the smart contract deployed on the blockchain. You have to download a chrome extension Metamask for making a transaction of gas fee and storing it in Blockchain. Every authenticated user can curtail their link by paying a nominal gas fee, the smart contract then returns a hash which can be easily mapped with that link. There is also a dashboard where user can see all converted link.

### Tech

Curtaily uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* ReactJS - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* Solidity - Writing Smart Contract
* Twitter Bootstrap - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* Firebase authentication service

And of course Curtaily itself is open source.
